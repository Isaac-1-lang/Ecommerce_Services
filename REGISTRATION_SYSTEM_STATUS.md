# Registration System Status

## Current Implementation

The registration system has been successfully restructured with three distinct registration flows:

### 1. Customer Registration
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional
- **Fields**: Basic registration (firstName, lastName, email, password, role)
- **Backend Support**: ✅ Complete

### 2. Admin Registration  
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially functional
- **Fields**: Basic registration + business info + payment info (UI only)
- **Backend Support**: ⚠️ Basic registration only
- **Notes**: Business and payment fields are UI-only for now

### 3. Employee Registration
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially functional  
- **Fields**: Basic registration + employee info + admin token (UI only)
- **Backend Support**: ⚠️ Basic registration only
- **Notes**: Employee-specific fields are UI-only for now

## Backend Limitations

The current backend registration endpoint (`/v1/auth/register`) only accepts:
- `firstName`
- `lastName`
- `email` 
- `password`
- `role`

## Frontend Features (UI Only)

The frontend includes these additional fields that are not yet supported by the backend:

### Admin Registration
- Business Name
- Business Address  
- Payment Method (Card Number, Expiry, CVV, Cardholder Name)

### Employee Registration
- Admin Token
- Employee ID
- Department
- Position

## Future Development Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Enhancement
1. Extend the registration endpoint to handle additional fields
2. Add validation for business and payment information
3. Implement admin token validation for employee registration
4. Add database fields for new user properties

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration
1. Enable all form fields to send data to backend
2. Add proper validation for all fields
3. Implement admin token generation and validation
4. Add profile update endpoints for additional information

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Admin token management system
2. Business verification process
3. Payment processing integration
4. Employee onboarding workflow

## Current Implementation

The system now works by:
1. Collecting all information in the UI
2. Only sending basic fields to backend (firstName, lastName, email, password, role)
3. Backend creates user and returns token directly
4. Storing user data and token in localStorage
5. Redirecting directly to appropriate dashboard based on role
6. Showing users that advanced features are coming soon

## Redirection Flow

After successful registration:
- **Customer** → `/dashboard`
- **Admin** → `/admin` 
- **Employee** → `/employee`
- **Delivery Partner** → `/delivery`

The redirection happens automatically after 1 second, and the user is already authenticated.

## Testing

To test the current system:
1. **Customer Registration**: Should work completely and redirect to `/dashboard`
2. **Admin Registration**: Should work for basic fields only and redirect to `/admin`
3. **Employee Registration**: Should work for basic fields only and redirect to `/employee`

All registrations will:
- Create the user account in the backend
- Automatically log in the user to get authentication token
- Store user data and token in localStorage
- Redirect to appropriate dashboard after 1 second
- User will be authenticated and can access their dashboard

## Current Working Flow

1. **User fills registration form** (basic fields only)
2. **Form submits to backend** (`/v1/auth/register`)
3. **Backend creates user** and returns success response
4. **Frontend automatically logs in** user to get JWT token
5. **User data and token stored** in localStorage
6. **User redirected** to appropriate dashboard based on role
7. **Dashboard loads** with user authentication intact

## Fixed Issues

✅ **500 Error**: Resolved by only sending backend-supported fields  
✅ **Redirection**: Direct redirection from registration to appropriate dashboards  
✅ **Authentication**: User automatically logged in after registration  
✅ **Role-based Access**: Proper redirection based on user role  
✅ **UI Clarity**: Clear messaging about future features
