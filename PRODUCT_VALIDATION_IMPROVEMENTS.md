# Product Creation Validation Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the validation improvements made to the product creation form to prevent 500 errors by ensuring all required backend fields are properly validated on the frontend.

## Required Backend Fields
Based on the backend requirements, the following fields are **MANDATORY**:
- `name` (string)
- `sku` (string) 
- `basePrice` (number)
- `categoryId` (number)

## Validation Improvements Made

### 1. Frontend Required Field Validation
- **Product Name**: Now required with real-time validation
- **SKU**: Now required (was previously optional) with minimum 3 character validation
- **Base Price**: Required and must be greater than 0
- **Category**: Required selection from dropdown

### 2. Real-Time Field Validation
- Added `validateField()` function that validates individual fields as user types
- Added `fieldErrors` state to track validation errors per field
- Fields show red borders and error messages when invalid
- Form submission button is disabled until all required fields are valid

### 3. Comprehensive Form Validation
- Added `validateFormData()` helper function that checks all required fields
- Added `isFormValid()` function to determine if form can be submitted
- Validation runs before form submission to prevent backend errors

### 4. SKU String Handling
- SKU is now explicitly converted to string using `String()` before sending to backend
- SKU is trimmed to remove whitespace
- SKU validation ensures it's at least 3 characters long

### 5. Category ID Conversion Safety
- Enhanced `getCategoryId()` function with additional validation
- Ensures category slug exists before attempting conversion
- Throws descriptive error if category not found

### 6. User Experience Improvements
- Visual feedback showing form validation status
- Submit button disabled until form is valid
- Clear error messages for each invalid field
- Success/error status indicators

## Form Validation Flow

1. **Real-time validation**: As user types, fields are validated immediately
2. **Field-level errors**: Invalid fields show red borders and error messages
3. **Form-level validation**: Submit button only enabled when all required fields are valid
4. **Backend validation**: Final validation before sending data to prevent 500 errors

## Error Prevention

The following scenarios that could cause 500 errors are now prevented:

- **Missing SKU**: SKU is required and validated as string
- **Invalid category**: Category selection is required and validated
- **Empty name**: Product name is required and cannot be empty
- **Invalid price**: Base price must be a positive number
- **Type mismatches**: SKU is explicitly converted to string, numbers are parsed properly

## Testing Recommendations

1. Try submitting form with empty required fields
2. Verify SKU is sent as string to backend
3. Test category selection validation
4. Confirm price validation works correctly
5. Verify form submission is blocked until all fields are valid

## Backend Compatibility

All required fields now match the `BackendProductPayload` interface:
- `name: string` ✅
- `sku: string` ✅ (explicitly converted)
- `basePrice: number` ✅
- `categoryId: number` ✅

This ensures the frontend data structure matches exactly what the backend expects, preventing validation and type mismatch errors.
