# Timeout Fixes for Product Creation

## Problem
Users were experiencing "timeout of 10000ms exceeded" errors when creating products, causing the process to fail.

## Root Causes
1. **Default timeout too short**: 10 seconds was insufficient for complex product creation
2. **Backend processing time**: Product creation with images/variants takes longer
3. **Network latency**: Remote backend server may have slower response times
4. **Large data payloads**: Multipart form data with images can be slow to process

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Increased Timeout Configuration**
- **Main API**: Kept at 10 seconds for regular operations
- **Product API**: Increased to 30 seconds for product creation
- **Separate API instance**: Created `productApi` with longer timeout

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Timeout detection**: Specific error messages for timeout scenarios
- **HTTP status handling**: Better error messages for 400, 413, 500 errors
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear explanations of what went wrong

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- **Progress indicators**: Shows "Creating Product..." with spinner
- **Timeout warnings**: Informs users that creation may take up to 30 seconds
- **Status messages**: Clear feedback during the creation process

### 4. **Technical Improvements**
- **Dedicated API instance**: `productApi` with optimized settings for products
- **Request interceptors**: Proper token handling for product API
- **FormData optimization**: Efficient data structure for backend processing

## Code Changes Made

### `lib/api.ts`
- Added `productApi` instance with 30-second timeout
- Separate request interceptors for product operations
- Maintained backward compatibility with main API

### `services/productService.ts`
- Updated to use `productApi` instead of main `api`
- Enhanced error handling for timeout scenarios
- Better logging for debugging

### `app/admin/products/new/page.tsx`
- Added `isCreating` state for better progress tracking
- Progress message during product creation
- Timeout warning for users
- Improved button states and loading indicators

## Expected Results

1. **No more timeout errors**: 30-second timeout should handle most product creation scenarios
2. **Better user feedback**: Users know the process is working and how long it might take
3. **Improved error handling**: Clear messages when things go wrong
4. **Faster debugging**: Better logging for troubleshooting

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create simple products**: Test with minimal data (no images/variants)
2. **Create complex products**: Test with images, variants, and warehouse data
3. **Monitor console logs**: Check for detailed request/response information
4. **Test network conditions**: Simulate slower network connections

## Future Improvements

1. **Progressive timeout**: Start with 30s, increase if needed
2. **Retry mechanism**: Automatically retry failed requests
3. **Background processing**: Move to async job processing for very large products
4. **Progress tracking**: Show actual progress percentage during creation

## Notes

- **30-second timeout**: Should be sufficient for most product creation scenarios
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Performance**: No impact on other API operations
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging for better debugging
